# SLIDER PUZZLE SOLVER
This project aims to solve the 3x3 [slider puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle) using 
different informed and uninformed search algorithms. The problem consists of a combination puzzle that 
challenges a player to slide pieces along certain routes to establish a certain end-configuration. 

# Requirements
- [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

# Setup
On the root project folder run the command `pipenv install`. This will install all necessary Python dependencies
get the project up and running.

# Usage
To run the puzzle solver you **MUST** follow the next steps:
1. Generate or modify a yaml config file specifying the algorithm and parameters to be used. You can find
a default config file (***config.yaml***) explaining all possible parameters value.
2. Run the solver with the following command.
```bash
  pipenv run slider_puzzle.py [config_file_path] [output_file_path]
```
Where:
  - config_file_path: specifies the path to a valid yaml configuration file. Defaults to **"config.yaml"**
  - output_file_path: specifies the path to the output file containing the found solution. 
  Defaults to **"solution.yaml"**

## Configuration File
The configuration file must be a valid yaml file with the following structure:
```
---
#slider puzzle config
config:
  #search algorithm to be used by the solver
  #possible options are:
  # - bfs
  # - dfs
  # - iddfs
  # - hls
  # - hgs
  # - a_star
  algorithm: 'algorithm'

  # depth limit for iddfs [ignored for other algorithms]
  limit: 'limit'

  # heuristic to be used for informed search algorithms [ignored for other algorithms]
  #possible options are:
  # - manhattan
  # - hamming
  # - overestimated
  heuristic: 'heuristic'

...
```

## Solution File
A solution yaml file will be generated by the solver with the following structure:
```
algorithm: "algorithm used"
solution_found: "true or false depending if a solution was found"
objective_distance: "distance from the root node to the objective"
objective_cost: "cost from the root node to the objective"
explored_nodes: "explored nodes to reach the objective"
border_nodes: "border nodes count when the objective was found"
processing_time: "algorithm processing time for solution"
solution:
  init_state: 'initial state matrix'
  intermediate_states: 'list contining intermediate states matrix'
  final_state: 'final state matrix'
```
