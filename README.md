This project aims to solve the 3x3 [slider puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle) using 
different informed and uninformed search algorithms. The problem consists of a combination puzzle that 
challenges a player to slide pieces along certain routes to establish a certain end-configuration. 

## TP2

This project aims to solve the [0-1 Knapsack Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) using Genetic
Algorithms. The Knapsack Problem is an example of a combinatorial optimization problem, which seeks to maximize the
benefit of objects in a knapsack without exceeding its capacity.
