# SIA TPs

## [TP1 - 3x3 SLIDER PUZZLE](https://github.com/FrBernad/SIA/tree/main/TP1)

This project aims to solve the 3x3 [slider puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle) using 
different informed and uninformed search algorithms. The problem consists of a combination puzzle that 
challenges a player to slide pieces along certain routes to establish a certain end-configuration. 

## [TP2 - 0-1 KNAPSACK PROBLEM](https://github.com/FrBernad/SIA/tree/main/TP2)

This project aims to solve the [0-1 Knapsack Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) using Genetic
Algorithms. The Knapsack Problem is an example of a combinatorial optimization problem, which seeks to maximize the
benefit of objects in a knapsack without exceeding its capacity.

## [TP3 - NEURAL NETWORKS OPTIMIZATIONS](https://github.com/FrBernad/SIA/tree/main/TP3)

This project aims to solve different problems using a variety of neural networks strategies.
It makes use of:
- Simple Perceptron
- Linear Perceptron
- Non-Linear Perceptron
- Multilayer Perceptron

## [TP4 - UNSUPERVISED NETWORKS](https://github.com/FrBernad/SIA/tree/main/TP4)

This project aims to solve different problems using a variety unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
It makes use of:
- Kohonen Networks
- Oja Rule
- Hopfield Networks
